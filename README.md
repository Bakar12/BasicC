# C Programming Projects

This repository contains three simple C programs: a basic calculator, a temperature converter, and a factorial calculator.

## Basic Calculator

The Basic Calculator (`BasicCalculator.c`) is a console application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To use the calculator, run the program and follow the prompts in the console. You will be asked to choose an operation and then enter the numbers to be calculated.

## Temperature Converter

The Temperature Converter (`TempConv.c`) is a console application that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

To use the converter, run the program and follow the prompts in the console. You will be asked to choose whether you want to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and then enter the temperature to be converted.

## Factorial Calculator

The Factorial Calculator (`FactorialCalc.c`) is a console application that calculates the factorial of a given number.

To use the calculator, run the program and follow the prompts in the console. You will be asked to enter a number, and the program will calculate and display the factorial of that number.

## Running the Programs

To compile and run the programs, you will need a C compiler such as GCC. Here are the general steps to compile and run the programs:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file you want to run.
3. Compile the C file using your C compiler. If you're using GCC, the command would be `gcc filename.c -o filename`.
4. Run the compiled program. On a Unix-like system, you would use `./filename`. On Windows, you would use `filename`.

Replace `filename` with the name of the file you want to run (`BasicCalculator`, `TempConv`, or `FactorialCalc`).

Please note that these instructions assume that you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't, you'll need to install one.
